# HadiGPT
A personalized chatbot created using OpenAI's GPT-3 Davinci model. This chatbot has a focus on Science and Technology with features like: Fine-tuned GPT-3 parameters, user-specific context, and the ability to handle multi-turn conversations. As I progress with this project, I will tweak and personalize this chatbot to give smarter, and more accurate responses.

#  What is GPT-3?
GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) is a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model developed by OpenAI. The model is based on the transformer architecture and has been trained on a massive amount of text data, making it capable of generating human-like responses to natural language input.

# GPT-3 Davinci Model
The GPT-3 model comes in several different sizes, with the largest and most powerful being the "GPT-3 Davinci" model. This model has 175 billion parameters, making it one of the largest and most complex NLP models ever developed. The Davinci model is capable of performing a wide range of tasks, including language translation, content generation, and question-answering, among others.
